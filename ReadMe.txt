#Creating a login and registration system using C++ 
#Explanation
-> first we will give two options for user 1st one is are you want to register or want to login 
-> then if he wants to register then we ask to enter the username and password and we store this into a file .
-> then if the user want to login , we ask to user please enter the username and password then we will check the
    username and password that user enter is present in our file if not we print a message that  "Invalid username and password"  ,
    if present then we print a message that "successfully login".
-> This is the overall logic about this project see the source code you will clarify more.
