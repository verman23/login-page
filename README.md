#Creating a login and registration system using C++.
 Explanation:-
 
 First, we will give two options for the user 1st one is are you want to register or login.

Then if he wants to register then we ask to enter the username and password and we store this into a file.

Then if the user wants to log in, we ask the user to please enter the username and password then we will check the
    username and password that the user entered is present in our file if not we print a message that  "Invalid username and password",
    If present then we print a message that "successfully login".
    
 This is the overall logic of this project see the source code you will clarify more.
